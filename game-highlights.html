            <p>The main highlights of this game are its story moments and cutscenes.Mainly the most praiseworthy story is definitely the latest update world penacony where the story was cleanly explained from different perspectives and showed us the motives of every character involved in the story.</p>

            <h3>Important Events</h3>
            <p>The most important event in any gacha game is obviously the Character event banners.</p>
            <img src="HSR image5.webp" alt="event banner">
            <p>Event banners or in HSR terms known as Warp Banners is the place where the gacha system takes place i.e, where we can get the desired chracter we want by spending the ingame currency known as Stellar jades.  </p>
            <p> For instance, each version lasts for six weeks, and there are always two phases of the version, where each lasts for three weeks. When the three-week timer is over, players will see a change in the featured Warp Banner. Therefore, when a banner drops, Trailblazers have that much time to grind the game for every drop of Stellar Jade.</p>
            <h3>Infographics and Statistics</h3>
            <div class="infographic">
                <img src="HSR infograph1.webp" alt="Infographic 1">
                <p>This is just one character's infograph named Jingliu who is a limited 5-star character and as you can see this infograph represents the materials she needs and also what technique and Light Conewe should prefer for her to get maximum damage outta her .</p>
